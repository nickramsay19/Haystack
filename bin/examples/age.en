; this program produces a single boolean of the value (a && b), where a, b are user given
push 0          ; keep a zero in case the AND evaluates to zero and
read            ; condition a
copy
read            ; condition b
add             ; a + b = 0, 1 or 2
maybe pop       ; clear the push 0 from above to keep the stack clean
then push 1     ; [a+b, 1]
sub             ; if a+b > 0, [a+b - 1] = [0, 1], else [0]
; now the item at the top of the stack is the boolean of a AND b
