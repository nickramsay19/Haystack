; this program inverts the the boolean value at the top of the stack
read ; condition to be inverted

; convert user input to boolean 1 or zero
push 1
read
maybe pop
or push 0

; begin inverting boolean
push 1 ; [x, 1]
sub ; [x - 1] = [-1/0]
maybe push 1 ; if (x-1 == -1 == true) then replace it with 1
; now the item at the top of the stack is inverted
